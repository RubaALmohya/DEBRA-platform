# Project Name: DEBRA platform

## Idea:

DEBRA platform for offering software projects, so that the user is allowed to submit his request with details and the amount for this project on the platform, experts choose the appropriate project for them and communicate with the user and an agreement is reached after that, the completion of the project is followed up by both parties. And the other part of the platform is for the auction, where experts are allowed to put up finished projects ready for use, and the auction is opened to users and the Moderator who can control which project can be in auction or not.

## Inspiration:
- The reason for my first concern was the girls of the camp.
- The Fenjan episode podcast (Amer Hashem Al-Qahtani).
